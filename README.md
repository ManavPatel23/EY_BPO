# AI-Driven Workflow Automation for Indian BPOs

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to enhance efficiency in Indian BPOs by leveraging AI-driven automation for workflow management, fraud detection, and customer interaction handling. Traditional processes suffer from inefficiencies such as manual scheduling, lack of sentiment-based prioritization, and agent burnout. Our AI-powered solution streamlines operations, optimizes task prioritization, and enhances security.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
### Challenges in Traditional BPO Workflows:
🔴 **Manual Scheduling** – Agents spend excessive time managing callbacks and follow-ups.
🔴 **No Sentiment-Based Prioritization** – Urgent claims are not addressed in real-time, leading to delays.
🔴 **Tedious Knowledge Retrieval** – Agents struggle to find relevant information quickly.
🔴 **Fraud Risks** – Manual claim verification is prone to errors and inefficiencies.
🔴 **Inefficient Call Routing** – Customers often get redirected multiple times before reaching the right agent.
🔴 **Agent Burnout** – Repetitive tasks increase workload, reducing overall efficiency and satisfaction.

## ✅ Proposed Solution
Our AI-powered workflow automation system provides the following solutions:
- **Automated Scheduling & Callbacks** – AI-driven follow-up automation saves time and optimizes workflows.
- **Sentiment Analysis for Prioritization** – NLP-powered urgency detection enhances client satisfaction.
- **AI Knowledge Assistant** – Provides instant, accurate information, reducing agent effort.
- **Fraud Detection Using ML** – Detects anomalies in claims, reducing false claims and fraud risks.
- **Automated Claim Process** – AI optimizes scheduling, prioritization, fraud detection, document processing, tracking, and smart routing for a seamless experience.
- **Smart Call Routing** – AI efficiently directs customers to the right agent, minimizing redirections.
