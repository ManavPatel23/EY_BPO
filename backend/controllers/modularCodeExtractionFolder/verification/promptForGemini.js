    return `Analyze the following patient details from different medical documents and verify consistency:
       ${JSON.stringify(template, null, 2)}
      Please check and report following these specific rules:
  
      1. Field Priority Weights:
         - Name: 50% of total score (Critical identifier field)
         - Blood Group: 25% of total score
         - Gender: 25% of total score
  
      2. Null Value Handling:
         - Ignore any fields that are null or undefined in documents
         - Only compare fields that have actual values
         - If a field is missing in a document, skip that document for that field's comparison
  
      3. For each field (name, bloodGroup, gender):
         - List all unique non-null values found
         - Compare only between documents where the field has a value
         - Identify discrepancies only between non-null values
         - Calculate consistency based only on documents where the field is present
  
      4. Match Percentage Calculation:
         - Calculate separate consistency scores for each field:
           * Name consistency score (50% weight):
             - If name is consistent across all non-null instances: 50 points
             - If any name discrepancy exists: 0 points
           * Blood Group consistency score (25% weight):
             - Consistent: 25 points
             - Inconsistent: 0 points
           * Gender consistency score (25% weight):
             - Consistent: 25 points
             - Inconsistent: 0 points
         - Final match percentage = Sum of all weighted scores
  
      5. Overall assessment:
         - Mark as inconsistent (isConsistent: false) if name has ANY discrepancy
         - For other fields, note discrepancies but weight them less severely

  fraudDetectionCheck: (medicalData) => {
    return `Analyze the following medical case for potential fraud by evaluating pre-operative care, medical records, operation details, doctor's notes, and overall surgical justification:
  ${JSON.stringify(medicalData, null, 2)}

  **Evaluation Criteria (Fraud Detection vs. Legitimate Case Validation):**

  1. **Pre-Operative Care (Key Indicator)**
     ✅ Legitimate:  
     - **Any** checkup within the **last year** before surgery (not strictly 3 months)  
     - Some indication of progression, even if detailed records are limited  
     - Some specialist involvement preferred but **not mandatory**  

     ❌ Fraud Indicators:  
     - **No medical visits at all** before surgery  
     - Sudden surgery with **no prior mention** of the condition  

  2. **Diagnostic Evidence (Reasonable Proof of Necessity)**
     ✅ Legitimate:  
     - **At least one** piece of supporting medical evidence (imaging, lab tests, or doctor’s notes)  
     - Surgery performed based on **clinical assessment**, even if full diagnostics are missing  

     ❌ Fraud Indicators:  
     - **No supporting documentation at all**  
     - Conflicting reports that contradict the need for surgery  

  3. **Surgical Justification (Medical Necessity)**
     ✅ Legitimate:  
     - **Prior treatment attempts are preferred but not required** if surgery was clearly needed  
     - Direct surgery allowed if the condition was severe and urgent  

     ❌ Fraud Indicators:  
     - **No clear reason** for skipping conservative treatment  
     - No documentation explaining why immediate surgery was chosen  

  4. **Documentation Integrity**
     ✅ Legitimate:  
     - Some missing documents are acceptable if available records **logically support the procedure**  
     - Doctor’s notes should provide a **general timeline** of care  

     ❌ Fraud Indicators:  
     - **Key records completely missing** (e.g., no pre-op notes, no surgery report)  
     - No rationale provided for major medical decisions  

  **Fraud Risk Calculation (More Flexible for Legitimate Cases):**  
  - **0-20%**: No Fraud Risk ✅ (Well-documented, reasonable case)  
  - **21-40%**: Low Risk ⚠️ (Some minor gaps but mostly legitimate)  
  - **41-60%**: Moderate Risk 🚧 (Lacking documentation but case seems reasonable)  
  - **61-80%**: High Risk 🚨 (Major inconsistencies, unclear necessity)  
  - **81-100%**: Critical Fraud Risk ❌ (Severe documentation gaps, likely fraud)

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Consistency Check (30% weight)
   - Use matchPercentage directly as the score.

2. Medical Data Check (45% weight)
   - Convert riskPercentage to a legitimacy score using: (100 - riskPercentage).

3. Billing Data Check (25% weight)
   - Convert fraudPercentage to a legitimacy score using: (100 - fraudPercentage).

Final Score Calculation:

Output Format:
- Individual component scores
- Final weighted legitimacy score (1-100)
- Explanation of calculation
- Claim approval recommendation based on score:
  80-100: ✅ Approved
  60-79: ⚠️ Further Review Required
